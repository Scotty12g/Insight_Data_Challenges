# Insight_Data_Challenges

As part of the Insight Data Science fellowship, we were given three data challenges. For each of these challenges, we were given a data prompt and 4 hours to  assess the problem, clean the data, run our analyses, and list some insights/recommendations. The projects within this section are on the raw-side, in that they have not been touched or cleaned up following their 4 hour allotment and submission. The topics include:

* Data Challenge 1: Employee Retention

* Data Challenge 2: A/B Pricing Test

* Data Challenge 3: User Conversion Rate
